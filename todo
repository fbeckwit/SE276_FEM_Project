Make the integration order a member variable passed to the element via the
constructor.
  -> Will be necessary for materials that carry state information.  Each
  -> integration point will have a unique material with different state.

Make the Element a base class from which other elements such as quadratics or
u-p formulations can be derived. ----------------  DONE!
  -> Continue identifying functions that need specialization and make virtual.

Do the same for materials.
