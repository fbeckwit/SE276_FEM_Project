Implement the element stiffness routine by using a functor instead of
calculating Gauss integration points on the outside.

Make the integration order a member variable passed to the element via the
constructor.
  -> Will be necessary for materials that carry state information.  Each
  -> integration point will have a unique material with different state.

Make the Element a base class from which other elements such as quadratics or
u-p formulations can be derived.

Do the same for materials.
